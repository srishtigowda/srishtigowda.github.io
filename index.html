					<p> Maybe you're not a fan of cake frosting. Well lucky for you, because the fruit cake in the first picture is a delicious alternative. You can never go wrong with bread in the second picture. If the other foods on this website, aren't what you like, try some bread, and eat it with butter. It is really good! A lot of people don't like Coffee, and if that's you, try the Hot Chocolate in the third picture!</p>
